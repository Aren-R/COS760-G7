# Impact of Reference Corrections on Machine Translation Model Rankings in Low-Resource African Languages

This project investigates how reference corrections in the FLORES evaluation dataset (devtest sets) for four African languages, Hausa, Northern Sotho (Sepedi), Xitsonga, and isiZulu, affect machine translation (MT) model rankings. Although the original FLORES dataset made important strides in covering low-resource languages, it contained numerous translation inaccuracies. These inconsistencies compromise the reliability of standard evaluation metrics and can distort model rankings, leading to misleading conclusions in MT research.

## Overview

We examine the impact of manually corrected references (from Abdulmumin et al., 2024) on MT model evaluation. Our analysis focuses on changes in model rankings, score sensitivity across metrics (BLEU, COMET, BERTScore), and variation across text domains.

## What We Did

- **Model Output Evaluation**: We evaluated outputs from several MT models (NLLB, OPUS-MT, MADLAD-400) using both original and corrected references.
- **Ranking Analysis**: We assessed how model rankings changed post-correction and analysed which models were most robust or sensitive to reference quality.
- **Metric Comparison**: We calculated score differences and Spearman’s correlation to measure the ranking volatility for each model-metric combination.
- **Domain-Level Exploration**: We examined if the thematic domain of the text influenced score deltas or ranking shifts.

## How to Use This Work

Use our findings to better understand how MT model rankings are affected by data quality in underrepresented languages. Our corrected reference datasets and evaluation scripts help support more equitable and accurate benchmarking practices.

## Responsible NLP Statement

Our work contributes to responsible NLP by highlighting how poor reference translations can unfairly penalise or benefit certain models, especially in low-resource settings. Ensuring reliable evaluation is crucial for the ethical development of MT tools that may influence education, information access, and digital equity in African communities.
